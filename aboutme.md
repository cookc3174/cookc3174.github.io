Christopher Cook

TL;DR: My name is Chris Cook and I am going to major in computer science at Allegheny College. Ever since I first heard about software and programming, I have always wanted to make a career out of it.

I was born in Springville, New York in 1998. I grew up in a small town called Gowanda. I lived there most of my childhood life. I attended Gowanda High School and graduated in 2016.

During my years in high school, I worked for a company called Superior Contracting. I started working under Superior when I was 16 years old. I was mostly responsible for finishing wood work and cleaning. I worked under my step father and learned a great amount over the years.

While growing up, technology was constantly an interest of mine. I had always wondered how they made computers faster. When I first heard about programming and how important it was to society, I wanted to get more involved with it. I would also always keep myself up to date with the newest software Microsoft came out with. Microsoft has some of the best programmers in the world and I would do anything to be apart of it. One of the first steps I took to prepare myself for a career in programming is taking courses in high school that dealt with programming. One course that has helped me the most so far is the computer science introductory course I took. I learned all about the basics of computer science and how it is changing the world. After taking this course I decided I wanted to major in computer science. This course also helped me decide what college to attend.

I decided to attend Allegheny College, located in Meadville, Pa. I choose to come here because I thought Allegheny was going to give me the best education. I was also interested in the courses that Allegheny had to offer in the computer science field. During my time at Allegheny, I hope to learn as much as I can about software. I wish to gain as much knowledge as I can because I want to pursue a career that has to deal with software.

TL;DR: Piracy is a problem that businesses and individuals are trying to resolve.

We all love to listen to music that we download and use the programs we get for free. We download as many songs as we can and get a hold of software that usually costs hundreds of dollars. However, we forget that there are laws and even consequences against people who pirate music and software. Most of us think piracy is not a real crime and we do it anyway. Piracy is one of the most unrated subjects in today's society because not everyone knows how drastic the effects are. It has affected many groups and people over the years. Many of these people are taking action into to stopping pirating because it is causing them to lose profit in their businesses. Even though piracy seems like it causes no harm, you are essentially stealing from someone else.

Article 1:
    When I first heard that we would be using GitHub and Markdown to publish articles on a mobile-ready web site, I was really interested. I had no idea what it would be like writing articles using Markdown and publishing them with GitHub. It turns out I actually really liked using these tools. I feel that because they are different it makes writing actually fun. You can also see your published work at any time becuase it live on the Internet. It is also really easy to edit the pieces you write because you can just edit them and use the terminal to update your website. One of the problems I didn’t like with using GitHub and Markdown was that it got kind of confusing at points. Sometimes I would get stuck and would have no idea what the problem was.

Article 2:
    I had never been really good at presenting before, but now that I have taken this FS 102 class I feel more confident as a presenter. Using GitHub and Reveal.js has certainly been beneficial to me. It is really easy to use both of the tools and it makes creating presentations a breeze. The presentations also look professional and are more comfortable to present with. However, there was really only one type of format we used and everyone’s presentations looked the same.  If there was an easier way to to make the format of the presentations different that would be helpful.

  One of the greatest tools humans have gotten to use is the Internet. The Internet can help solve any problem at anytime. One of the good parts about using the web is that anyone can use it. It is very simple and easy to access. The use of the Internet in today's society has improved many people's lives. To me the most important part of the Internet is the learning and educational opportunities it offers. The web is full of informational articles and videos that people can view to gain more knowledge on a particular subject.

  One of the most popular ways people try to get information off the Internet is by watching online videos on YouTube. YouTube is an online video-sharing website that many people use to guide them through problems they do not know how to solve. This website alone has improved the lives of millions. You can find almost any video on the subject of your desire. I have personally used YouTube to help me answer questions that I had. This website has helped me tremendously in categories such as learning code. When I first learned about programming and writing code, I had no idea what was going on. One of the first steps I took to learn more about code is taking a intro to computer science class in high school. Although, this class taught me the basics of programming, I felt that it was not enough. I then began to look up articles of code and tips for programming. After doing all of this I have learned that you can not just learn code, it takes time and practice.

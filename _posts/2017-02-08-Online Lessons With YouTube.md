  One of the greatest tools humans have gotten to use is the Internet. The Internet can help solve any problem at anytime. One of the good parts about using the web is that anyone can use it. It is very simple and easy to access. The use of the Internet in today's society has improved many people's lives. To me the most important part of the Internet is the learning and educational opportunities it offers. The web is full of informational articles and videos that people can view to gain more knowledge on a particular subject.

  One of the most popular ways people try to get information off the Internet is by watching online videos on YouTube. YouTube is an online video-sharing website that many people use to guide them through problems they do not know how to solve.

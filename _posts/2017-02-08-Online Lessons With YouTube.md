TL;DR: The Internet is a powerful tool we can use to solve most of the problems we have. One example that has helped me is YouTube. I have strengthened my skills in programming by watching videos on YouTube.

One of the greatest tools humans have gotten to use is the Internet. The Internet can help solve most of our problems. One of the good parts about using the Internet is that anyone can use it. It is very simple and easy to access. The use of the Internet in today's society has improved many people's lives. To me the most important part of the Internet is the learning and educational opportunities it offers. The web is full of informational articles and videos that people can view to gain more knowledge on a particular subject.

One of the most popular ways people try to get information off the Internet is by watching online videos on YouTube. YouTube is an online video-sharing website that many people use to guide them through problems they do not know how to solve. This website alone has improved the lives of millions. You can find almost any video on the subject of your desire. I have personally used YouTube to help me answer questions that I had. This website has helped me tremendously in categories such as learning code. When I first learned about programming and writing code, I had no idea what was going on. One of the first steps I took to learn more about code is taking a intro to computer science class in high school. Although this class taught me the basics of programming, I felt that it was not enough. I then began to look up articles of code and tips for programming. After doing all of this I have learned that you can not just learn code and expect to know it all, it takes time and practice.

After taking a few computer science courses at Allegheny College, I have found myself using YouTube more. The lectures might talk about pieces of code or information about programming briefly, but they will not go into depth. I feel that it is almost required that you look up code on the Internet because you are not really exploring the code in the way that you should be. With videos on YouTube you can see all types of code. You can see how it is properly formatted and how you use it to affect other pieces of the program you are writing. You can also watch the code being created. This is important because if you can see how to write new code from someone else, it will be easier for you to write the same code in the future. One of the best parts about watching videos on YouTube is that there are millions of them. Someone can easily teach themself how to write code from just watching videos on the Internet. There are so many categories on a particular subject that it is almost impossible not to find what you are looking for.

The use of the Internet today has made life more efficient. With everything being digitalized, the world is at your finger tips. Any problem or concern you have can be resolved with the use of the Internet. YouTube is one example that has made the world a better place. Without YouTube there would be too many unanswered questions. One of the greatest parts about using YouTube or the Internet in general, is that it saves time. Without these tools people would be left to figure the problems they have by themselves. I think using tools, such as YouTube, have made the world a better place. Life is easier and no one has to struggle.

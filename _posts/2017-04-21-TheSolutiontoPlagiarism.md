TL;DR: Plagiarism has increased dramatically over the last few years because of technology. People have found many loopholes around laws and copyright strikes, however publishers and owners of stolen work are finding solutions to this.

Recent improvements in technology have changed the way people use the Internet. Today, for example, many students are finding the Internet to be a great tool to get help with homework. This, however, is problematic, since students who look up answers on the Internet can simply copy and paste them without any intention to memorization. Students that plagiarize are only learning how to cheat and copy other people's work. What if there was a way we could help these students? Instead of just copying somebody else's work, why not learn from it and try to forge new ideas and perceptions?

I feel that if we taught students a way to help them learn instead of copy, it would dramatically decrease the amount of people that plagiarize today. People would get ideas from similar topics that relate to the one they have to write about or do a project on. By reading other people's work you can generate ideas of your own to help you structure what you are going to do in your own assignment. However, people would have to be careful not to copy or paraphrase because without cited sources this would still be considered plagiarism. Students have a hard time knowing when to cite and when not to. Schools need to teach their students that if you are getting ideas from another source you need to cite them, even if you just get an idea from one of them. You may not realize that the work you created is similar. The programs schools use to check for plagiarism will catch these similarities and will show that your paper is plagiarized, even though you didn't even intend to. The whole point is to get kids to learn instead of copying. Learning from other people can be really beneficial and will help you all through out your life.

This idea could have several objections. One part about my solution that people would disagree with is that students should already know how to cite material they get from other people. Personally, I do not think schools teach kids how to actually generate ideas from the research they gather. Also, some readers may challenge my view by insisting that students will take it for granite and not really care and will continue to copy anyway. If kids are properly taught how learn from other authors, they are going to use this new skill to their advantage. The last objection I might get is that people will feel it's too basic. That is why so many students and kids plagiarize work today, it's too easy for them. We need to take a different approach. Instead of just making programs to catch and get them in trouble, Why not teach them how to make ideas of their own?

The use of the Internet and its powers are evolving. You can find almost any topic of your desire with almost no problems. With it being this easy to find material people have taken advantage of it and have abused the power of on-line sources. There is no way to stop people from looking at these sources to get ideas. However, there are other ways we can teach students to use the Internet. If we teach them, it will show that plagiarism is wrong and that it is better to just come up with your own ideas.

TL;DR:Google is hurting students because it making them become less independent on their studies.

When people have problems that they can't solve, they might go look for answers on the Internet. They are most likely using a search engine called Google. This is an efficient way to look for answers because it is fast and saves time. However, what people do not know about using Google is that they are becoming lazier. Every time someone gets answers off the Internet they are usually not making an attempt to actually learn the material they are copying. Not everyone can see the consequences of getting information off Google. Also, people who use Google as a crutch to solve the problems they have in their daily lives struggle. Google is used for almost anything you can think of, so people can struggle in many categories. Where people struggle the most is with education. Students that have grown up using Google as a source for answers have weakened their problem solving skills.

At a very young age kids learn to use the Internet. Some kids use Google without even knowing what it really is. Most of them think Google is the Internet and that it is a place where you can find anything you want. Kids who are not taught how to properly use Google will abuse the sources it has to offer. Google can be abused in many ways by students. It can be used to get answers for typical homework assignments. If a student is not doing homework by themselves and copying, they are not going to understand the material they have been learning in class. Google can also be used to help with essays. This is where students get in the most trouble. If a student copies or forgets to site the sources that they found on the Internet, they will get penalized. This is not good for any student. Students who get in the habit of plagiarizing will not be able to get out of it. Every school and college has penalties against plagiarizing and some of these include getting kicked out.

Students in middle and high school will definitely branch out to Google when they are need of assistance. Even though students can seek help from a teacher of a professor, they choose to use Google because it is much easier. However, if they are not using Google to learn they are only going to hurt themselves later in the future.

TL;DR:Google is hurting students because it making them become less independent on their studies.

When people have problems they usually go look for answers on the Internet. They are most likely using a search engine called Google. This is an efficient way to look for answers because it is fast and saves time. However, what people do not know about using Google is that they are becoming lazier. People who use Google as a crutch to solve the problems they have in their daily lives struggle. Google is used for almost anything you can think of, so people can struggle in many categories. Where people struggle the most is with education. Students that have grown up using Google as a source for answers have weakened their problem solving skills.
